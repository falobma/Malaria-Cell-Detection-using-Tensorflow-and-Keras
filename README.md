# Malaria-Cell-Detection-using-Tensorflow-and-Keras
Detecting cell that parasitezed with malaria, the end result shows 99.7% accuration

the Dataset is from : https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria or https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/
The Dataset itself contain 27558 cell images.
in this program I'm using keras sequential with softmax activation output layer rather than sigmoid one. 

from the dataset I devide 90% of the data for training and 10% for testing. \n
Hope you can learn one or two thing from this program ! 
Cheers !
